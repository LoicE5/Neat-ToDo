# How to run the project

## Create a .env file for the server (only once)
`cd server && cp .env.example .env`

For this exercise purpose, you don't need to edit the .env config (you may if you desire to). It works from scratch with the example. Indeed, in a business context, we don't do that.
Then set a JWT_SECRET as well as your credentials for your MySQL DB.

Note : Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` (if applicable), some bugs may occur.

## Run

### Development
`npm run dev`

**For only front-end or server :** `npm run dev:frontend`or `npm run dev:server`

### Production
`npm run build`

**For only front-end or server :** `npm run build:frontend`or `npm run build:server`

Then, open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`.
